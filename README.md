# Computer Vision - Object Tracking with OpenCV and Python

This is based on a Coursera guided project on OpenCV and Python with the following learning Objectives:-

1. `Optical Flow`.

2. `Dense Optical Flow`.

3. `MeanShift`.

4. `CamShift`.

5. `Single Object Tracking`.

6. `Multi Object Tracking`.

I have got a little idea about all of these afer this Project, but still need to learn more about `OpenCV` and other python deep-learning functionalities.
